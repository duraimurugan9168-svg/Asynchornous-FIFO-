# Asynchornous-FIFO-
<h3><u>Project Overview:</u></h3>
               
               
This project implements a fully parameterized Asynchronous FIFO in Verilog HDL to enable safe and reliable data transfer between independent clock domains. The design follows CDC-safe methodologies, utilizing Gray-code pointers and 2-flip-flop synchronizers to mitigate metastability issues. Binary pointers are used for internal memory addressing, while Gray-coded pointers handle cross-domain communication. Full and Empty flags are generated using synchronized pointers to ensure stable, glitch-free control. The FIFO supports configurable data width and depth, and its functionality is validated through simulation under wrap-around conditions, simultaneous read/write operations, and boundary cases.

<h3><u>Problem statement:</u></h3>

In multi-clock digital systems, direct data transfer between asynchronous clock domains can cause metastability and data corruption.
This project addresses the problem by designing a CDC-safe Asynchronous FIFO in Verilog HDL.
The FIFO ensures reliable data transfer using Gray-code pointers and synchronized control logic.
Correct operation is maintained under clock mismatch, pointer wrap-around, and boundary conditions

Depth     : 8
Inputs    : Binary Input

Conditions: 1.Set
            2.Reset

<h3><u>Features:</u></h3>

FSM states:
         INPUT → EMPTY → PARTIALLY FULL → FULL → OUTPUT
         
Explanation:

EMPTY (0): No data, read disabled, write enabled

PARTIALLY FULL (1 → N-1): Some data, read and write both enabled

FULL (N): All entries occupied, write disabled, read enabled

🔸Binary and Gray-code address generation for metastability-resilient pointer movement.

🔸2-flip-flop synchronizers for reliable cross-domain pointer transfer.

🔸Gray↔Binary converters to maintain CDC safety while enabling binary-domain comparisons.

🔸Full/Empty flag logic driven by synchronized pointers.

<h3><u>Tools & Hardware Used:</u></h3>

FPGA: ZedBoard Zynq-7000

HDL Tool: AMD Vivado 2024 Edition

Language: Verilog HDL

Verification: Vivado Simulator / Testbench for functional validation

<h3><u>  Read & Write operations: </u></h3>

An Asynchronous FIFO enables safe data transfer between two independent clock domains using separate read and write pointers. There is no global FSM; instead, operation is controlled by pointer comparison and FULL/EMPTY flags.

**Operational Principle**

Write side operates only on wr_clk

Read side operates only on rd_clk

Pointers are maintained in binary (for addressing) and Gray code (for CDC safety)

Gray-coded pointers are synchronized across clock domains using 2-FF synchronizers

**Write & Read — Unified Flow:**

On wr_clk (Write Domain):

A write occurs when:

wr_en = 1

full = 0


Actions:

Write data to memory at the current write pointer address

Increment the binary write pointer

Convert the updated pointer to Gray code

Synchronize the Gray-coded write pointer to the read domain

**On rd_clk (Read Domain):**

A read occurs when:

rd_en = 1

empty = 0

Actions:

Read data from memory at the current read pointer address

Increment the binary read pointer

Convert the updated pointer to Gray code

Synchronize the Gray-coded read pointer to the write domain

**FULL & EMPTY Flag Generation:**

EMPTY (Read Domain):
Indicates no unread data is available

FULL (Write Domain):
Indicates FIFO has reached maximum capacity

**Simulation Waveform:**

This waveform represents the functional simulation of an Asynchronous FIFO where write and read operations occur in different clock domains (wr_clk and rd_clk). The FIFO safely transfers data across clock domains using synchronized pointers.
