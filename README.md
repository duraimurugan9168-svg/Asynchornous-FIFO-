# Asynchornous-FIFO-
<h3><u>Project Overview:</u></h3>
               
               
This project features a parameterized Asynchronous FIFO in Verilog, designed for reliable data transfer across independent clock domains. It employs industry-standard CDC (Clock Domain Crossing) techniques to ensure data integrity and system stability..

<h3><u>Problem statement:</u></h3>

In multi-clock digital systems, direct data transfer between asynchronous clock domains can cause metastability and data corruption.
This project addresses the problem by designing a CDC-safe Asynchronous FIFO in Verilog HDL.
The FIFO ensures reliable data transfer using Gray-code pointers and synchronized control logic.
Correct operation is maintained under clock mismatch, pointer wrap-around, and boundary conditions

Depth     : 8
Inputs    : Binary Input

Conditions: 1.Set
            2.Reset
            
States    : Empty(0)  Almost Empty(1)  Partial conditio(2-5)  Almost Full(6)  Full(7)

<h3><u>Features:</u></h3>

FSM states:
         INPUT → EMPTY → PARTIALLY FULL → FULL → OUTPUT
         
**Explanation:**

EMPTY (0): No data, read disabled, write enabled

PARTIALLY FULL (1 → N-1): Some data, read and write both enabled

FULL (N): All entries occupied, write disabled, read enabled

🔸Binary and Gray-code address generation for metastability-resilient pointer movement.

🔸2-flip-flop synchronizers for reliable cross-domain pointer transfer.

🔸Gray↔Binary converters to maintain CDC safety while enabling binary-domain comparisons.

🔸Full/Empty flag logic driven by synchronized pointers.

<h3><u>Tools & Hardware Used:</u></h3>

FPGA: ZedBoard Zynq-7000

HDL Tool: AMD Vivado 2024 Edition

Language: Verilog HDL

Verification: Vivado Simulator / Testbench for functional validation

<h3><u>  Read & Write operations: </u></h3>

An Asynchronous FIFO enables safe data transfer between two independent clock domains using separate read and write pointers. There is no global FSM; instead, operation is controlled by pointer comparison and FULL/EMPTY flags.

**Operational Principle**

Write side operates only on wr_clk

Read side operates only on rd_clk

Pointers are maintained in binary (for addressing) and Gray code (for CDC safety)

Gray-coded pointers are synchronized across clock domains using 2-FF synchronizers

**Write & Read — Unified Flow:**

On wr_clk (Write Domain):

A write occurs when:

wr_en = 1

full = 0


Actions:

Write data to memory at the current write pointer address

Increment the binary write pointer

Convert the updated pointer to Gray code

Synchronize the Gray-coded write pointer to the read domain

**On rd_clk (Read Domain):**

A read occurs when:

rd_en = 1

empty = 0

Actions:

Read data from memory at the current read pointer address

Increment the binary read pointer

Convert the updated pointer to Gray code

Synchronize the Gray-coded read pointer to the write domain

**FULL & EMPTY Flag Generation:**

EMPTY (Read Domain):
Indicates no unread data is available

FULL (Write Domain):
Indicates FIFO has reached maximum capacity

<h3><u>Asynchrnous FIFO states:</u></h3>
The below image indicates the FIFO states for the system of depth 8

**State Breakdown (Depth 8)**
The numbers above the boxes represent the occupancy count (how many data slots are currently filled).

**EMPTY (0)**: The starting state. The buffer contains no data. Any attempt to read from here would typically trigger an Underflow.

**ALMOST EMPTY (1):** Only one slot is filled. This is a critical threshold state often used to signal the consumer to stop reading soon.

**PARTIALLY FULL OR EMPTY (2-5):** The "normal" operating range. The FIFO is neither nearing its maximum capacity nor its empty state.

**ALMOST FULL (6):** The buffer is nearing capacity. Only one or two slots remain. This signals the producer to slow down or stop writing.

**FULL (7-8):** The buffer has reached its maximum capacity.

**Error Conditions**

**OVERFLOW:** This occurs if the system attempts to write (DATA_IN) more data when the state is already FULL. This results in data loss as there is no space left.

**UNDERFLOW:** This occurs if the system attempts to read data when the state is EMPTY. This results in invalid data being passed to the next stage.

<h3><u>Design.v:</u></h3>
This design implements an asynchronous FIFO that allows safe data transfer between two independent clock domains (wr_clk and rd_clk). Design code for Asynchronous FIFO is given below

<h3><u>Testbench:</u></h3>
The testbench verifies the functionality of the asynchronous FIFO by generating independent write and read clocks, applying reset, and driving controlled write and read enable signals.

<h3><u>Simulation & Waveform:</u></h3>
This waveform represents the functional simulation of an Asynchronous FIFO where write and read operations occur in different clock domains (wr_clk and rd_clk). The FIFO safely transfers data across clock domains using synchronized pointers.
