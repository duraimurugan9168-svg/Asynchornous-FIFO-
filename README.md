# Asynchornous-FIFO
<h3><u>PROJECT OVERVIEW:</u></h3>
               
               
This project implements a parameterized Asynchronous FIFO in Verilog HDL for reliable data transfer between independent clock domains.
The design ensures Clock Domain Crossing (CDC) safety using Gray-code pointers and dual flip-flop synchronizers, effectively preventing metastability and data corruption.

The FIFO supports robust flow control, boundary-condition handling, and debug-friendly error signaling, making it suitable for FPGA-based real-time systems and multi-clock SoC designs.

<h3><u>PROBLEM STATEMENT:</u></h3>

In multi-clock digital systems, direct data transfer between asynchronous clock domains can cause metastability and data corruption.
This project addresses the problem by designing a CDC-safe Asynchronous FIFO in Verilog HDL.
The FIFO ensures reliable data transfer using Gray-code pointers and synchronized control logic.
Correct operation is maintained under clock mismatch, pointer wrap-around, and boundary condition

Inputs:

Binary data input (din)

Conditions:

Reset

Write enable (wr_en)

Read enable (rd_en)

Logical Flow:
INPUT → WRITE → READ → OUTPUT


<h3><u>FEATURES:</u></h3>

 -  Fully parameterized FIFO (Data Width & Depth)
 
 -  Independent write and read clocks
 
 -  Binary & Gray-code pointer architecture
 
 -  2-FF synchronizers for CDC safety
 
 -  Accurate FULL / EMPTY flag generation
 
 -  Almost Full / Almost Empty early-warning flags
 
 -  Overflow & Underflow detection with visible pulse stretching
 
 -  Automatic operational mode selection (Write / Read controlled by flags)
 
 -  Verified for wrap-around and simultaneous R/W operations
 
**Explanation:**

EMPTY (0): No data, read disabled, write enabled

PARTIALLY FULL (1 → N-1): Some data, read and write both enabled

FULL (N): All entries occupied, write disabled, read enabled

🔸Binary and Gray-code address generation for metastability-resilient pointer movement.

🔸2-flip-flop synchronizers for reliable cross-domain pointer transfer.

🔸Gray↔Binary converters to maintain CDC safety while enabling binary-domain comparisons.

🔸Full/Empty flag logic driven by synchronized pointers.

<h3><u>TOOLS AND HARDWARE:</u></h3>

<h3><u>  BLOCK DIAGRAM: </u></h3>

The below block diagram shows how the Asynchrnous FIFO works

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="WRITE POINTER BLOCK" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3ec50de-ef2f-40c1-af0d-c1ea826cfbff" />


**Read & Write operations:**

An Asynchronous FIFO enables safe data transfer between two independent clock domains using separate read and write pointers. There is no global FSM; instead, operation is controlled by pointer comparison and FULL/EMPTY flags.



**Operational Principle**

Write side operates only on wr_clk

Read side operates only on rd_clk

Pointers are maintained in binary (for addressing) and Gray code (for CDC safety)

Gray-coded pointers are synchronized across clock domains using 2-FF synchronizers

**Write & Read — Unified Flow:**

On wr_clk (Write Domain):

A write occurs when:

wr_en = 1

full = 0


Actions:

Write data to memory at the current write pointer address

Increment the binary write pointer

Convert the updated pointer to Gray code

Synchronize the Gray-coded write pointer to the read domain


### **Async FIFO Operational Principle (Short)**

* **Write side** operates on `wr_clk`

* **Read side** operates on `rd_clk`

* Pointers are kept in:

  * **Binary** → memory addressing
  * **Gray code** → safe clock-domain crossing (CDC)

* Gray-coded pointers are synchronized across domains using **2-FF synchronizers**

---

 **Write Domain (`wr_clk`)**

* Write when `wr_en = 1` and `full = 0`
* Actions:

  * Write data to memory
  * Increment write pointer (binary → Gray)
  * Sync write Gray pointer to read domain

---

 **Read Domain (`rd_clk`)**

* Read when `rd_en = 1` and `empty = 0`
* Actions:

  * Read data from memory
  * Increment read pointer (binary → Gray)
  * Sync read Gray pointer to write domain

---




**FULL & EMPTY Flag Generation:**

EMPTY (Read Domain):
Indicates no unread data is available

FULL (Write Domain):
Indicates FIFO has reached maximum capacity

<h3><u>ASYNCHRNOUS FIFO STATES:</u></h3>
The below image indicates the FIFO states 

<img width="1240" height="701" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/432d89ff-c023-4fdf-8ee3-c3ce5860b088" />



**EMPTY :** The starting state. The buffer contains no data. Any attempt to read from here would typically trigger an Underflow.

**ALMOST EMPTY :** Only one slot is filled. This is a critical threshold state often used to signal the consumer to stop reading soon.

**PARTIALLY FULL OR EMPTY :** The "normal" operating range. The FIFO is neither nearing its maximum capacity nor its empty state.

**ALMOST FULL :** The buffer is nearing capacity. Only one or two slots remain. This signals the producer to slow down or stop writing.

**FULL :** The buffer has reached its maximum capacity.

**Error Conditions**

**OVERFLOW:** This occurs if the system attempts to write (DATA_IN) more data when the state is already FULL. This results in data loss as there is no space left.

**UNDERFLOW:** This occurs if the system attempts to read data when the state is EMPTY. This results in invalid data being passed to the next stage.

<h3><u>CONCLUSION:</u></h3>

This project successfully demonstrates the design and verification of an Asynchronous FIFO for reliable data transfer between two independent clock domains. By using Gray-coded read and write pointers along with dual flip-flop synchronizers, the design effectively mitigates metastability issues common in CDC systems. The FIFO correctly generates Full, Empty, Almost Full, and Almost Empty flags, ensuring safe and efficient flow control. Simulation results confirm correct operation during normal, boundary, and wrap-around conditions. This implementation provides a robust and scalable solution suitable for real-time embedded and FPGA-based communication systems.
