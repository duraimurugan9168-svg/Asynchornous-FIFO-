# Asynchornous-FIFO
<h3><u>PROJECT OVERVIEW:</u></h3>
               
               
This project implements a parameterized Asynchronous FIFO in Verilog HDL for reliable data transfer between independent clock domains.
The design ensures Clock Domain Crossing (CDC) safety using Gray-code pointers and dual flip-flop synchronizers, effectively preventing metastability and data corruption.

The FIFO supports robust flow control, boundary-condition handling, and debug-friendly error signaling, making it suitable for FPGA-based real-time systems and multi-clock SoC designs.

<h3><u>PROBLEM STATEMENT:</u></h3>

In multi-clock digital systems, direct data transfer between asynchronous clock domains can cause metastability and data corruption.
This project addresses the problem by designing a CDC-safe Asynchronous FIFO in Verilog HDL.
The FIFO ensures reliable data transfer using Gray-code pointers and synchronized control logic.
Correct operation is maintained under clock mismatch, pointer wrap-around, and boundary condition

**Inputs:**

-  Binary data input (din)

**Conditions:**

-  Reset

-  Write enable (wr_en)

-  Read enable (rd_en)

**Logical Flow:**

INPUT → WRITE → READ → OUTPUT

**The block diagram illustrates:**

- Separate read and write clock domains

- Binary and Gray-code pointer paths

- Synchronization across clock domains

- FULL / EMPTY flag generation

### **Async FIFO Operational Principle:**

Although no global FSM is used, the FIFO implicitly operates in multiple modes, determined by pointer comparison and status flags:

➤ **WRITE MODE**

-  wr_en = 1

-  full = 0

-  Data is written safely into FIFO memory

-  Write pointer increments (Binary → Gray)

➤ **READ MODE**

-  rd_en = 1

-  empty = 0

-  Data is read from FIFO memory

-  Read pointer increments (Binary → Gray)

➤ **FULL MODE**

-  FIFO reaches maximum capacity

-  Write operations are automatically blocked

-  Read operations remain enabled

➤ **EMPTY MODE**

-  FIFO contains no valid data

-  Read operations are blocked

-  Write operations remain enabled

**Mode selection is automatic and flag-driven**, requiring no FSM — improving reliability across clock domains.



 ➤ **FULL & EMPTY Flag Generation:**

 -  **EMPTY (Read Domain):**
     Indicates no unread data is available

 -  **FULL (Write Domain):**
     Indicates FIFO has reached maximum capacity

<h3><u>ASYNCHRNOUS FIFO STATES:</u></h3>
The below image indicates the FIFO states 

<img width="1240" height="701" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/432d89ff-c023-4fdf-8ee3-c3ce5860b088" />



-  **EMPTY :** The starting state. The buffer contains no data. Any attempt to read from here would typically trigger an Underflow.

-  **ALMOST EMPTY :** Only one slot is filled. This is a critical threshold state often used to signal the consumer to stop reading soon.

-  **PARTIALLY FULL OR EMPTY :** The "normal" operating range. The FIFO is neither nearing its maximum capacity nor its empty state.

-  **ALMOST FULL :** The buffer is nearing capacity. Only one or two slots remain. This signals the producer to slow down or stop writing.

-  **FULL :** The buffer has reached its maximum capacity.

**Error Conditions:**

-  **OVERFLOW:** This occurs if the system attempts to write (DATA_IN) more data when the state is already FULL. This results in data loss as there is no space left.

-  **UNDERFLOW:** This occurs if the system attempts to read data when the state is EMPTY. This results in invalid data being passed to the next stage.

<h3><u>CONCLUSION:</u></h3>

This project successfully demonstrates the design and verification of an Asynchronous FIFO for reliable data transfer between two independent clock domains. By using Gray-coded read and write pointers along with dual flip-flop synchronizers, the design effectively mitigates metastability issues common in CDC systems. The FIFO correctly generates Full, Empty, Almost Full, and Almost Empty flags, ensuring safe and efficient flow control. Simulation results confirm correct operation during normal, boundary, and wrap-around conditions. This implementation provides a robust and scalable solution suitable for real-time embedded and FPGA-based communication systems.



**NOTES:**

This project improved my understanding of clock domain crossing issues and the practical use of Gray code and synchronizers in FPGA designs. It also strengthened my skills in Verilog coding, simulation, and debugging timing-related problems.
